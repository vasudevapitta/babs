    <h1>If I were yours</h1>
    <pre class="body-poem-text">
    You would fight for me
    You would cherish me
    You would treat me as fragile as Glass
    and as Rare as Gems
    Only you could pick on me

    If I were yours,
    You’d stalk my teachers if there
    waswrongdoing
    You’d go to the ends of the earth
    Our Christmas would be special,
    and I’d be included
    Our extended family would know
    who I am,
    that I belong to you,
    and with that strong connection,
    I belong to them.

    If I were yours,
    I would be your favorite
    Nothing I could do would separate
    me from you
    Your door would always be open,
    because you wouldn’t be able to
    see me suffer
    You would pray for me
    You would hope for my future

    If I were yours,
    Even my broken heart wouldn’t
    question it after a while
    I wouldn’t have to knock before
    I entered your home
    You would miss me
    You would bother me about homework
    My unique qualities would always
    astound you

    If I were yours,
    I’d be your little star
    I’d be your little princess
    You’d make every effort to fulfill
    my hopes and dreams
    You would cry when I do not fulfill
    yours

    If I were yours,
    The idea of me staying with
    strangers would frighten and
    outrage you When I ask the question,
    “What if I were yours?”
    you would know exactly how I should
    be treated, it would be so natural,
    and so clear…
